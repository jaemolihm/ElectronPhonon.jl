# BoltzmannCalculator: an AbstractCalculator that accumulates the BTE scattering-out (Sₒ) and
# scattering-in (Sᵢ) matrices during a single pass of `run_eph_over_k_and_kq`. It uses BandStates /
# imap addressing; rather than copying g2/ωq it folds the temperature-dependent occupation physics
# into Sₒ/Sᵢ via the shared `bte_scattering_increments` (see src/boltzmann/bte_scattering_core.jl).
#
# One calculator, both backends: the same calculator instance is used on CPU or GPU — the backend is
# chosen by `run_eph_over_k_and_kq`'s `use_gpu`, which dispatches `run_calculator!` on the payload
# type: `ElPhDataPoint` (host loop, per (ik,iq,ikq)) or `ElPhDataOuterKBatched` (device, per k-batch).
# Both fold the identical `bte_scattering_increments`, so they compute the same scattering (to
# round-off); the CPU path also serves as the validation reference for the GPU path.
#
# Output layout is what the transport solver (`solve_electron_bte` / `solve_thermoelectric_bte`)
# consumes unchanged:
#   Sₒ :: Vector{Vector}  — Sₒ[iT][i]      (inverse SERTA lifetime γ_{nk})
#   Sᵢ :: Vector{Matrix}  — Sᵢ[iT][i, f]   (scattering-in kernel)
#
# Supported configuration (asserted at setup): FermiDirac occupation + Gaussian smearing — the
# configuration `bte_scattering_increments` implements and the one used for transport.
#
# GPU device memory (Sᵢ): the scattering-in matrix Sᵢ (n_i·n_f·nT) is the large object. On the GPU it
# is never held whole on the device — it is tiled over outer k, each tile filled by one k-batch and
# streamed to the host (OuterIterationBatch begin/end brackets), so only one tile (≈ one k-batch of rows)
# is device-resident. This bounds device memory to the tile regardless of grid size at no measurable
# speed cost: streaming is within ~2% of a single whole-Sᵢ copy even at 1.1 GB Sᵢ, because the D2H
# bytes moved are identical either way. There is deliberately no full-device-resident Sᵢ path. (Sₒ is
# small — n_i·nT — and stays device-resident, streamed once at the end.) See benchmark/README.md for
# the profile (and why the scatter kernel is NOT a negligible fraction of GPU time).

device-resident work of `run_calculator!(::BoltzmannCalculator, ::ElPhDataOuterKBatched, ctx)` (its sole caller, so it lives here). For every
`(m, n, j)` of the chunk look up the outer/inner states `i = imap_i_at_k[n]`,
`f = imap_f[m, ikqs[j]]` (skip if either is out-of-window, `== 0`), then for each temperature
`iocc` sum the shared per-mode physics (`bte_scattering_increments`) over the `nmodes` phonon modes
(`ωqmat[ν,j] ≥ ω_cutoff`) and:

  * `Sₒ_out[i, iocc] += Σ_ν sₒ`      — scattering-out, added over `(m, ν, j)` (many `(m,j)` map to
    the same outer `i`), so the device method uses an atomic add here. `Sₒ` is small (`n_i × nT`)
    and device-resident, so it is indexed by the GLOBAL outer state `i`;
  * `Sᵢ_out[i−i0, f, iocc] = Σ_ν sᵢ` — scattering-in; each `(i, f)` pair is produced by a unique
    `(n, m, j)` across the whole run (distinct k → distinct i, distinct k+q → distinct f), so this
    is a collision-free plain write (no atomics needed). `Sᵢ` is streamed to the host one tile per
    outer-k batch, so `Sᵢ_out` is the current tile and the row is the tile-local `i − i0`.

`imap_i_at_k` is `imap_i[:, ik]` — the outer-state indices at the batch's fixed outer k `ik`.
`i0` is the global-i offset of the current `Sᵢ` tile. Generic (CPU/fallback) method; the CUDA
extension provides the `CuArray` kernel. The physics lives entirely in `bte_scattering_increments`
so the two paths agree.
